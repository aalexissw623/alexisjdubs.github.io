<center><p>Blocks are the default display value for most elements. 
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the screen.</p></center>
    <p>Here are some block-level elements < div >:</p>
    <div>Hello, hello</div>
    <div>World</div>
    <p>In the above, the < div > is a block-level element and starts on a new line. 
       The < div > element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
       The < div > element has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.</p>
<br>
    <p>Here are some inline elements:</p>
    <span>Hello, hello</span>
    <span>Goodbye</span>
    <p>The < span > element is an inline element, so it will not start on a new line.
       The < span > element is often used as a container for text.
       Similarly, it has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.
