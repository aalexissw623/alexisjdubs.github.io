    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ever wondering what to eat for your next meal? Your next late-night binge? Need a little spin and a party for your tastebuds? If you want something to chow down on, Zesty 'n' Tasty has got it all.</p>
    <p>Zesty 'n' Tasty is mostly a food and restaurant recommendation site, but we do have a recipes page in case you're in to let out your inner chef and get something cookin'. With restaurants in locations all around the United States and a few in Europe and Asia, Zesty 'n' Tasty is a site where you can find food from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Here at Zesty 'n' Tasty, we know food isn't all about taste. For a restaurant to be great, service, atmosphere, price, and much more all come into play. From each restaurant, we display a few of our favorite dishes. Prices are labelled with $ being the least expensive and $$$$ as the most. Restaurants are also conveniently labelled by location and country. Please note: Zesty 'n' Tasty does not host any alcoholic foods or beverages.</p>
    <p>Food: <i>Material consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, and fat used in the body of an organism to sustain growth, repair, and vital processes and to furnish energy.</i></p>
    <p class="quoteColorHome">"Food is the ingredient that binds us all together."</p>
